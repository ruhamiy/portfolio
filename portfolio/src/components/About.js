      <p className="intro">Passionate student developer eager to learn and grow.</p>

      <p>
        I am a 4th year Software Enigineering student at Addis Ababa University. I am highly
        motivated to gain hands on experience through internships and real world projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am more interested in frontend development and enjoy designing responsive and
        interactive user interfaces. Currently, I am also improving my backend skills
        to become a full-stack developer.
